CodeSkulptor-Mini-Projects
==========================

This repository contains all the Codeskulptor Mini-Projects Python Files. These files do not necessarily 
contain the correct code and is no way perfect, is more of a learning experience than anything.
This repository is made for a backup and revision of the course and is not intended to share it in public.

IMP:- Those who don't know what Codeskulptor is, for them this repository is of no use.
      
This are the MiniProject Programming Assignments from a course on Cousera by Rice University.
If want to run these codes, I recommend open www.codeskulptor.org ( a browser Python interpreter ), copy and paste 
desired code in the shell and click the play button on the top. 

The reason I recommended to run python code in Codeskulptor is most of the given files require simplegui module.
To install it on your desktop use the pip install :
      pip install SimpleGUICS2Pygame
Or visit the following link for urther information:
      http://simpleguics2pygame.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
It is recommended as simplegui has very limited features, it would be better if you run these codes on Codeskulptor.
